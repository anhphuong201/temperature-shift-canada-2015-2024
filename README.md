2. Are Canadian summers becoming hotter or more variable?
3. How do temperature trends differ across Canadian regions?
   
Insights:
1. Winter - Milder Trend, High Variability. Slight trend toward warmer mean temperatures (lower Heating Degree Days). Characterized by extreme year-to-year volatility
2.  Summer - Sharply Hotter and Volatile: Significant peaks in cooling needs (Cooling Degree Days in 2021 & 2024). Sharp increase in both heat and overall temperature volatility
3. Regional Disparity in Extremes: Highest temperature amplitudes in Northern Territories (YT, NT) and interior provinces (MB)
